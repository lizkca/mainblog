<h1>State of the Docs<a class="headerlink" href="#state-of-the-docs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>August has historical significance for Read the Docs, so it seemed fitting to
wrap up August by taking a moment to step back and reflect on what we’ve done in
the last year.</p>
<p><em>What makes August so significant for us?</em></p>
<p>For starters, this August saw the <a class="reference external" href="http://ericholscher.com/blog/2010/aug/16/announcing-read-docs/">5th birthday of Read the Docs</a>!
We’re still humbled by the project’s success, and the important role it
continues to play for old and new users alike.</p>
<p>This growth was becoming difficult to manage without focused support given back
to the community. Though the project has always had core maintainers, for Read
the Docs to continue growing as a community resource, we knew it required
dedicated attention.</p>
<p>This is the reason why, in August of last year, Eric and I set out to create a
company around Read the Docs – another significant bookmark in Read the Docs’
history. We planned to build the company to fund the ongoing support efforts of
the community site and to help accelerate its growth. At this time last year, we
had just formed Read the Docs, Inc, we were fresh into the <a class="reference external" href="http://piepdx.com">PIE accelerator
program</a>, and we were planning how to bring our documentation values to
companies that weren’t open source.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-last-year">
<h2>The last year<a class="headerlink" href="#the-last-year" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our primary goal has always been to drive the development of our community site,
with hopes that it would one day be self-sustaining. We made a number of
decisions and changes to work towards this goal in the last year:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Treat the community site as a separate entity</dt><dd><p>In order to be independently sustainable, the community site needs income of
its own. The service is large enough now that dedicated staff is a
necessity. There needs to be someone to drive development, handle support
requests, and be accountable for keeping everything running.</p>
<p>Currently, all money coming into Read the Docs is treated as income into the
business. We do track income to the community site separately, so we can
budget for the community site separately from running the rest of the
business.</p>
<p>We aren’t yet to the point where this split is critical. There are no
employees of the business yet, and we are only able to pay ourselves for a
small portion of the work we perform for the community site.</p>
<p>We will need to track this explicitly as we grow however, as the community
site will need to rely on donations for the foreseeable future. Those
donations should not go towards developing the for-profit side directly.
Development of the community site will still be a primary function of income
into the for-profit side.</p>
<p>Eventually, the community site could be structured completely separate, to
provide a more explicit split.  It could probably be structured as a 501c,
This doesn’t make financial sense yet.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Our support fundraiser</dt><dd><p>In an effort to fund development and maintenance on the community site, we
decided to call on our community for financial support back in June.  This
was the first time we have asked the community for contributions.  Our goal
was to fund at least a portion of the time spent developing and supporting
the community site.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the contributors from our community, we raised our goal of
$24,000, and were able to fund the time of multiple engineers working
steadily on Read the Docs for the last few months.</p>
<p>We already outlined our costs and our plans behind our June fundraiser in a
previous post. We will be following up the last few months of work with an
overall review of the fundraiser and the work we performed in the coming
weeks.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Triaging</dt><dd><p>Hopefully, our support responsiveness has been more apparent.  One hurdle in
bringing on more engineers, and engaging the community more, was the lack of
formal ticketing and open decision making.  Gregor, among many other
changes, laid out a formal triage process that has been a major influence in
keeping an organized and healthy support queue.</p>
<p>We’ve definitely found that the more support engagement we provide the
community, the more support comes out of the woodwork.  This is all part of
supporting a healthy community however, as we have learned.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Stability</dt><dd>Read the Docs has “grown organically”, which is to say it has grown fast,
unwieldy, and in many directions.  With more proper focus on code quality,
including clean up efforts, refactoring, and long due upgrades, Read the
Docs has shed considerable technical debt in the last couple months.  This
work has already paid off in improving stability and predictability of the
project.</dd>
<dt>Ads</dt><dd><p>We ran a few tests with advertising on built documentation in the last few
months.  We discussed at length how we felt about ads and determined our own
problems with the standard implementation of ads is not the ads themselves,
but the breach of privacy they signify.</p>
<p>Because of that, we established that a requirement of us ever showing ads is
to not use third party tracking.  In fact, we look to remove all third party
tracking from built documentation as soon as we can.</p>
<p>To put ads into a clearer context, revenue from in-house ads fully cover our
costs each month, without asking the community for any further support. It
probably shouldn’t be surprising that advertising revenue is an easier
income source than seeking donations. We certainly feel Read the Docs
provides more value than the ads it would serve though. Our last fundraiser
reflected the value the community puts on the site, and we hope the next
fundraiser can be as successful.</p>
<p>Should we ever use ads as a primary revenue source for the community site,
we have established some rules:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We will provide our ads in-house, not through any service that establishes
third party tracking</li>
<li>We will not sell any data about our users</li>
<li>We will always prefer ad sponsorship from community members</li>
<li>Users that support us through donations or sponsorship are opt out of ads</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback regarding ads has been positive, hopefully our intentions with ads
has been mostly apparent. We’ll be discussing our thoughts on advertising in
more depth soon, if you have any feedback.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Gold</dt><dd><p>We’ve begun working on a “gold” status feature for users that want to
support us each month. This will be an optional, recurring subscription to
Read the Docs. The subscription will provide some additional features for
users or projects, and some advanced project features might suggest a gold
subscription for projects that make use of them.</p>
<p>This idea is still evolving, we’ll be asking for more feedback as this
feature matures.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-next-year">
<h2>The next year<a class="headerlink" href="#the-next-year" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>So, let us now set some expectations for the next year forward:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Transparency and feedback</dt><dd><p>Operating in the open has been an important tenant to our company since
formation.  We believe whole-heartedly in the trust and candid feedback it
provides, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opencompany.org/about/">we have pledged</a> to keep openness and transparency
at the core of the company.</p>
<p>Part of the structure that has guided us as a company has been providing
updates to those that we are accountable to. During our time at PIE, this
was to our mentors and our peers. Now, we want to be accountable to you, our
community.</p>
<p>We would like to continue the periodic updates that started with the
fundraiser, and we plan on releasing updates, on a quarterly basis, that
share more insights into the company.  We will continue to expose our goals,
problems, and decisions to you as we grow and we hope you can provide us
with your feedback.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Continued work towards stability</dt><dd>We still have some technical debt that will take a while to pay off,
but ensuring stability is paramount to having a service we can all rely on.</dd>
<dt>Support responsiveness</dt><dd>We will adhere as much as we can to the processes that we established around
our support channels. We hope that these processes will also allow others in
the community to easily fill these roles should we need the help.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for our technical goals, outside our roadmap and continued cleanup and
maintenance, here is what we have on our roadmap:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>User experience</dt><dd>With components becoming more stable, and a generally more stable code base,
we are shifting focus towards user experience – the pieces most obvious to
users. We’ve made some gains here in the past few months, but have a ways to
go still.</dd>
<dt>Easier documentation build tools</dt><dd>Sphinx is an incredibly powerful tool, but for new users this can be
overwhelming. We are developing tooling to ease this process for new users
and provide a solid footing for the majority of use cases. This will also
help to make the build process more predictable, as this would mimic our
build backend processes closely.</dd>
<dt>More reference doc language support</dt><dd>We have been working towards wider language support for generating API
reference documentation. Most recently, we worked with Microsoft to develop
support for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rtfd/sphinxcontrib-dotnetdomain">.NET language support in Sphinx</a>. This allows
authors to use existing .NET tooling to generate reStructuredText API
reference documentation.</dd>
