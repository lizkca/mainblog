&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since our &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ad-funding-read-the-docs-whats-next/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;last advertising update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and it felt like a good time to talk about what’s working with our advertising model
and how things are getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;how-advertising-is-working-for-read-the-docs&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How advertising is working for Read the Docs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../read-the-docs-2019-stats/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;2019 stats post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
we broke out our advertising revenue which was fairly flat year over year.
The way our ad business is structured, our revenue mostly grows with increases in traffic
and Read the Docs is mature enough that it isn’t doubling in size every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, we’re pleased with our steady and sustainable growth.
Read the Docs doesn’t have any investors putting pressure on us for short term growth
and that has allowed us to invest in our ad business, commercial hosting,
and in our community version for the long term.
We’ve rolled out a huge number of improvements to all the sides of our business
in the last year and we’re happy with the results.
Advertising remains the single largest source of funding for Read the Docs
and one that scales as our costs scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a real world note, Covid-19 had a short term impact on our advertising revenue
with a number of advertisers understandably pulling back due to uncertainty in funding and the economy in general.
While the world isn’t completely back to normal, we have returned some degree of normalcy
and most of these advertisers returned once there was a bit more clarity in the broader economy
and the virus’ effect on the tech industry specifically.
Advertising on Read the Docs is now close to capacity in the US, Canada, and Europe which are our largest advertising markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;improved-targeting-for-ads&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improved targeting for ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising on Read the Docs is different from most ad networks out there.
Our ad targeting is based on the content and the reader’s geography rather than personal data about our users.
Read the Docs’ authors and readers have told us that privacy is important to them.
That’s great because it’s important to us too!
With that said, there are great ways to target specific content niches with ads relevant to those readers without compromising on privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, we chose a few groups of content advertisers can target where we have enough traffic
without the ads being focused on a tiny number of projects.
These niches are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data science and machine learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend web development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backend web development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DevOps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested this improved content targeting with a select group of advertisers and the results were great.
In some cases we saw click through rates more than double.
Whether the ad is to hire a developer or to promote a service,
we always want to deliver ads that are most relevant to the documentation being served.
This results in better value to our advertisers
while still respecting the privacy of our readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonition-would-your-company-like-to-get-in-front-of-more-developers admonition&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;first admonition-title&quot;&gt;Would your company like to get in front of more developers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;last&quot;&gt;Tell your &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://readthedocs.org/sustainability/advertising/?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=readthedocs-blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ethical-advertising-2020&quot;&gt;marketing or recruiting team&lt;/a&gt; about Read the Docs
and show them how they can reach over 7 million developers who Read the Docs each month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;open-sourcing-our-ad-server&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open sourcing our ad server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we’ve wanted to do for a long time is open source the code
we use to run advertising at Read the Docs.
While there’s always a bit of an incentive to keep advertising code closed so it can’t be abused,
our hope is that the trust we’re building with the ethical ads model
can be used by others who want to run their own ethical advertising.
Read the Docs is an open source company and it’s nice to have all our code out there.
We call it the ethical ad server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ethical ad server is built to handle the kind of load Read the Docs itself receives
– over a million hits per day –
and it delivers advertising based only on content and geographic targeting
rather than building up user profiles from personal information.
It’s built from the ground up with user privacy in mind.
We’re excited to share it with you so please &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server&quot;&gt;check out the code on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as we’re constantly delivering improvements to Read the Docs itself for our readers and project maintainers,
we also strive to give a better experience and better results to the companies who trust Read the Docs as a marketing channel.
I want to thank all our advertisers who believe in our approach and continue to support us
and stay tuned to this space for more great features in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ethical ad network is just about ready for launch
and we’re actively looking for projects to beta test the network.
If you run a developer focused website and you’re looking for a way to earn money
without selling out your visitors’ privacy,
please &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:ads&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;readthedocs&amp;#46;org?subject=Ethical%20Ad%20Network%20beta&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="text">New Ad Format Coming to Read the Docs Community Sites</title>
    <id>https://blog.readthedocs.com/fixed-footer-ad-all-themes/</id>
    <updated>2019-06-18T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;new-ad-format-coming-to-read-the-docs-community-sites&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We view our ad program as a way to keep Read the Docs itself sustainable,
and to use it to better support the community.
Advertising has allowed us to have full-time employees adding new features
and responding to issues in our issue tracker.
We have also been able to share thousands of dollars with the open source community
via our revenue share program and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, about 30% of our site traffic does not have any advertising.
When we first launched ethical advertising in 2016,
we launched only on &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ads-on-other-themes/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;specific documentation themes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
We purposely did this slowly to make sure our ads look integrated
with Read the Docs and less obtrusive to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, this wasn’t a problem because we had not reached capacity with advertising.
We did not have enough paid advertisers to support the amount of pageviews Read the Docs served.
Fast forward a couple years,
and our advertising model has &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ad-funding-read-the-docs-whats-next/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;proven to be successful&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
In North America and Western Europe,
&lt;strong&gt;100% of pages that are eligible for paid advertising have a paid ad&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve hit that limit, it makes sense to expand to more themes.
Rather than going theme by theme as we did in the past,
especially considering the huge number of Sphinx themes,
we designed an ad that would work across all Sphinx themes.
This became much easier with a more simple text-only ad as you will see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be very explicit,
&lt;strong&gt;this new ad format will show advertising on all documentation themes&lt;/strong&gt;.
We plan to roll this new ad format out more widely in stages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To start with, we are going to enable this ad format for community and house advertising
on pages that already have ads on them.
As always, we never display two ads on the same page so this ad will be instead of any other ad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that, we will allow paid advertisers to use this new format.
Again, we will start only on pages that already have ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will email users of custom documentation themes to let them know this change is coming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At first, we will show only community and house ads on these custom themes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, we’ll turn on our normal ad rotation to all themes.
We expect to complete this by the end of July.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will closely monitor feedback from document authors, readers, and advertisers during this process.
If you have questions or comments on this, please &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:ads&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;readthedocs&amp;#46;org?subject=New%20Ad%20Format%20Feedback&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;text-only-ads&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Text-only ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve wanted to try text-only ads for a while but it took time to get it right.
From the start, we were very keen on text-only advertisements
because they aren’t as obtrusive as image-based ads
and they are easier for advertisers to create and experiment with multiple variations.
What we didn’t know was whether users would engage with them at similar rates to our other ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran a small experiment with a text-only house ad
on the Read the Docs documentation itself and the results were very promising.
Engagement rates were over double our site average
and even compared favorably with the same ad in the sidebar including an image.
Those figures may not hold up as the format is rolled out more widely but it is certainly a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-default&quot; id=&quot;id1&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;A text-only ad on the Read the Docs documentation. Yes, this new format will be blocked by most ad blockers.&quot; src=&quot;img/2019-text-only-ad.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 80%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;A text-only footer advertisement on the Read the Docs documentation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank Eric Berry over at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://codefund.io/&quot;&gt;CodeFund&lt;/a&gt; for some great ideas
and insights around this kind of ad format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;opting-out&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Opting Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand that advertising doesn’t work for everyone – even advertising without any user tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can opt-out of paid advertising themselves and for any projects they maintain
although they will still see community ads for open source projects and conferences.
Gold members of Read the Docs get an ad-free experience
and for companies we have our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://readthedocs.com/&quot;&gt;commercial offering at readthedocs.com&lt;/a&gt;
which is always ad-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to completely remove advertising from your open source project,
but our commercial plans don’t seem like the right fit,
please &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:ads&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;readthedocs&amp;#46;org?subject=Alternatives%20to%20advertising&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; to discuss alternatives to advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="text">Ad Funding at Read the Docs and What’s Next for Ethical Advertising</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ad-funding-at-read-the-docs-and-what-s-next-for-ethical-advertising&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been three years since we first launched &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ads-on-read-the-docs/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;ads on Read the Docs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and while we gave a limited update in our &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../read-the-docs-2018-stats/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;2018 stats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
we figured it was time to give an update on ethical advertising and how it is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;advertising-without-tracking&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advertising without tracking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our ethical advertising model is still going strong.&lt;/strong&gt;
We proved that it is possible to build a business model on top of advertising
without resorting to user tracking.
Unlike most other ad-supported sites, we show advertising based on the context of the page,
not by creating behavoral profiles of large numbers of individual users.
If you are browsing documentation for a Python project, you might see a relevant ad about Python.
It’s that simple and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a slow start to the year, we expect to earn about $75,000 from advertising in Q2.
This brings our advertising revenue back to the level
before our ads were &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ads-and-adblocking/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;added to major ad blocking lists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we do earn money from other sources such as our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://readthedocs.com&quot;&gt;commercial offering&lt;/a&gt;,
advertising continues to be our largest source of revenue and has allowed us
to expand our team to five full-time people.
Compared with three years ago when we were scraping along with very little money,
our community issue tracker and support requests receive prompt responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve made great progress on advertising over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We survived a major hit to revenue from ad blocking
without resorting to cat and mouse games of changing ad layouts and APIs to avoid ad blockers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/advertising/ethical-advertising.html#community-ads&quot;&gt;community ads program&lt;/a&gt; has been significantly expanded.
We are actively running free community advertising promoting over ten open source projects and conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we never tracked users with advertising,
we put in place stricter &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../do-not-track/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;Do Not Track&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; privacy protections.
We continue to believe that advertising can be well targeted without tracking users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We launched an advertising vertical to let companies
&lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../lessons-from-hiring-manager-interviews/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;promote their open jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our advertising revenue share program tripled in size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ethical advertising approach, with no user tracking, has been key to our sustainability
and has allowed Read the Docs to continue to build new features and give back to our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-s-next&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have some really interesting developments coming regarding ethical advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking to add a few more projects to our ad &lt;strong&gt;revenue share program&lt;/strong&gt;
and help more projects reach sustainability with an ethical advertising approach.
If your project on Read the Docs does 100k+ pageviews per month
and you are interested in exploring a new revenue stream, please &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:ads&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;readthedocs&amp;#46;org?subject=Ethical%20Ads%20revenue%20share&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are testing a &lt;strong&gt;new text-only ad format&lt;/strong&gt; which we will detail in a future post.
Text-only ads are something we’ve wanted for a while because we believe they are less intrusive to readers
but easy for advertisers to experiment with multiple variations.
So far the results have been very promising and we are planning to roll this out more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;strong&gt;ethical ad network&lt;/strong&gt; is getting closer to launch.
It’s a shame, but there’s a critical lack of funding for open source projects
that form the building blocks of some extremely valuable software.
We believe that advertising can fill some of that gap
and Read the Docs can help by sharing some of the lessons we’ve learned building our own advertising.
If you know a site that might be interested in being a beta tester
of a pro-privacy ad network built specifically to help fund open source,
please &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:ads&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;readthedocs&amp;#46;org?subject=Ethical%20Ad%20Network%20beta&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;thanks&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisers always have a choice where to direct their marketing spend
and for many of them it would have been simpler to just go with the usual behemoth advertising platforms
rather than advertising with a niche site like Read the Docs.
I want to thank all our advertisers who believe in our approach and continue to support us.&lt;/p&gt;

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;tips-for-getting-a-developer-interview&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last month, the Read the Docs team conducted 30-40 customer development interviews
with hiring managers and recruiters
at companies ranging from 5-person companies to the biggest names in tech.
We wanted to learn more about hiring processes at various companies
with the ultimate goal of building &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://readthedocs.org/sustainability/advertising/recruiting/?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=readthedocs-blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=next-developer-job&quot;&gt;a product to help companies find developers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time, we covered some &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../lessons-from-hiring-manager-interviews/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;tips for hiring managers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
based on what companies told us they were doing.
This time, we put together &lt;strong&gt;tips for candidates looking for their next job&lt;/strong&gt;
based on insights we heard from hiring managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than covering how to crack developer interviews
or how to gain the necessary technical skills,
these tips will focus on getting your foot in the door. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making your application stand out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving your application response rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting to the interview process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;when-applying-go-deep-not-wide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When applying, go deep not wide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“I don’t want candidates who drive by job sites and pepper every job they find”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a candidate, there is a temptation to play the numbers game and apply to as many jobs as possible.
Many jobs sites make it easy to apply to many jobs quickly and this gives you that feeling that your job search is progressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on what hiring managers told us, playing the numbers game isn’t the best approach.&lt;/strong&gt;
While it is a bit of a job-seekers market, especially for more senior talent,
companies are looking people who want to work for their company and who believe in their mission.
Hiring managers told us they want applicants who
“think about the company, then check for opportunities”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-default&quot; id=&quot;id1&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;A Facebook job post on LinkedIn with almost 300 applications in 2 weeks&quot; src=&quot;img/2019-facebook-job-opening.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;That’s almost 300 applications in 2 weeks on just one of the job sites where this is posted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;spend-a-little-more-time-on-your-application&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spend a little more time on your application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it takes longer to apply to a job post
that requires a cover letter or requires answers to a few questions,
those are great ways to have your application stand out relative to other applicants.
You don’t want your resume to get lost in a stack of hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../lessons-from-hiring-manager-interviews/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
quite a few hiring managers we talked to started requiring a cover letter
or even just a couple questions that are unique to the company
in order to make their job filtering candidates easier
and get candidates who want to work there not those who just want a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the companies we talked to said when they post a job they got tons of applicants,
but that high quality, qualified applicants were still in short supply.
When 200 people apply to a job but only 20 are willing to do a cover letter,
a hiring manager can spend a lot more time per candidate with the smaller pool.
One hiring manager told us explicitly “fewer resumes is better because there’s less noise”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I know I said getting a developer job isn’t a numbers game,
this doesn’t strictly mean you can use these techniques
to apply to 2-3 jobs and you’ll get hired.
Sometimes by the time you apply, somebody is already in the final stages of getting hired.
The position may not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; be open anymore.
Don’t get discouraged in your job search.
&lt;strong&gt;Finding the right match can take time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-default&quot; id=&quot;id2&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Questions from the DuckDuckGo application process&quot; src=&quot;img/2019-duckduckgo-application-questions.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Here’s some of the questions from the DuckDuckGo application process.
This is your place to stand out!
DuckDuckGo was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; one of the companies we interviewed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;make-yourself-a-referral-use-your-network&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Make yourself a referral: use your network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring managers universally told us their top recruiting channel
is referrals from existing employees.
As a candidate, use this knowledge to your advantage and
&lt;strong&gt;make yourself into a referral hire&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you see an acquaintance on social media post about job openings at their company?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does a friend or a friend of friend work at the company?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a first connection (or a very good 2nd connection) on LinkedIn who works there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of these cases, you should contact that person before applying.
Even if the person you know isn’t on the hiring team,
your contact might be able to put you in touch with the right person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“Most [senior] people go through their network”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a mid-level to senior candidate with 7+ years of experience,
this is even more important based on our interviews. At that stage of your career,
&lt;strong&gt;hiring managers we talked to expect a high quality candidate to do due diligence&lt;/strong&gt;
on the company and team to make sure it’s a mutual fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the exact route you take here,
getting in touch with the right people to learn more about the team,
the tech stack, and the company makes it clear that you’re very interested.
You’re far more likely to get a response, move on to the interview process,
and ultimately get hired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;establishing-contact-with-companies&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Establishing contact with companies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning yourself into a referral is easier for a senior candidate.
But what if this is your first or second job or don’t know anybody at the company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After referral candidates, &lt;strong&gt;the next best hiring channel in our interviews
was local meetups and engaging the local community&lt;/strong&gt;.
Both startups and established companies – especially when they are actively hiring –
use meetups to find talent.
If you’re able to meet the hiring manager in person or establish some sort of connection,
in my experience, this raises your chances significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our interviews, another channel that mid-size and larger companies
we talked to used to recruit was to rely on their presense at conferences.
For many companies,
recruiting was the primary motivator to sponsor a conference and have a booth.
As a candidate, talking to the engineers at the booth and showing interest
can ensure that your application doesn’t get lost among all the applicants they get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a smaller company, it’s frequently possible to figure out exactly
who the hiring manager is from some combination of the website,
hiring posts, and LinkedIn. This is a great way to make a valuable connection
and make sure the role is a good fit.
Contacting the hiring manager cold requires a bit of finesse so make sure to be respectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Places like the monthly HackerNews Who’s Hiring thread are fantastic
because they allow direct interaction with the hiring manager
and many companies list a person’s direct email to inquire about a position,
learn more directly from the source, and show you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-default&quot; id=&quot;id3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Some of the phrases heard from hiring managers in our interviews&quot; src=&quot;img/2019-hiring-manager-phrases.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Here’s some of the phrases we heard from hiring managers in interviews.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By spending a bit more time on your application,
establishing contact with the company, and asking good questions about the work and team,
you are showing your intent and interest in the company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to make sure the hiring manager or recruiter understands
that you’re a serious candidate and you want to work there on their team.
Using these methods will improve your response rate and &lt;strong&gt;help you get the interview&lt;/strong&gt;.
By doing a one-click apply on a job site, this is completely lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;thanks&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I’d like to thank all the hiring managers who took the time to talk to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title type="text">Lessons From and For Hiring Managers</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;lessons-from-and-for-hiring-managers&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last four weeks, the Read the Docs team did dozens of customer development interviews with engineering hiring managers.
We wanted to learn more about hiring processes at various companies
with the ultimate goal of building a product to help companies find developers.
We talked to people looking for talent at five person companies all the way up to the biggest names in tech.
In this post, I am going to cover some of the common things we heard from hiring managers
and &lt;strong&gt;share some ways for hiring managers to improve their company’s process&lt;/strong&gt;.
In our &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../tips-for-getting-a-developer-interview/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;next post in this series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I will have some actionable tips
for job seekers based on the same interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is a long post, I figured I’d share some of the key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a strategy for getting more referrals&lt;/strong&gt; whether that is actively asking employees or having an overly generous referral bonus.
Referrals are probably your top source of candidates so figuring out how to get more will save you time and money in the end.
Then do the same for your other best recruiting channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach passive candidates&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a lot more passive candidates than active ones so have a plan to reach them.
Great developers (especially senior ones) probably aren’t actively looking for a new job and it’s a job-seekers market.
Even if somebody isn’t considering a new job at all, the next time they do, you want them to think of your company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recruiting for diversity is a focus&lt;/strong&gt; for hiring managers.
Put together a concrete plan for getting more diverse candidates and meeting your diversity goals.
Engaging with local developer communities and nonprofits and encouraging referrals worked well for companies we talked to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get more signal in your application process&lt;/strong&gt; by adding a step such as a cover letter, quiz,
or simply add a couple questions folks have to answer.
Making candidates spend even one extra minute on their application can save you hours filtering resumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;why-is-read-the-docs-tackling-hiring-hasn-t-that-been-done&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is Read the Docs tackling hiring? Hasn’t that been done?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we didn’t initially think about Read the Docs ads for recruiting,
based on some &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../hiring-developers-with-readthedocs/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;unexpected past successes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
we decided to position promoted jobs as one of our main verticals within our advertising.
Rather than dash forward and create a product, however, we started by just talking to hiring managers
to understand the hiring process better so we can best meet their needs with something we create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the questions we asked in our interviews was how long it took to hire their most recent developer?
Specifically, we asked hiring managers to consider how much time they and their team spent sourcing candidates,
filtering resumes, preparing for and doing phone and onsite interviews, and anything else.
Internal recruiters’ time is valuable too, but we figured the hiring manager
would probably underestimate how much time the recruiter spent since they didn’t directly observe it.
While answers were all over the place, the range with the most overlap was &lt;strong&gt;50-100 hours of engineering time to make a hire&lt;/strong&gt;.
No huge revelation here, but companies make a massive investment in hiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my days being an interviewer at Qualcomm and Amazon as well as a smaller startup,
I’d say fifty hours is on the low side for big company but about right for a smaller company.
When something costs 50+ engineering hours to do,
any improvement is worth a lot of time and money
and at Read the Docs we believe we can help significantly here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;top-hiring-channels&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top hiring channels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was no big surprise to hear that &lt;strong&gt;referrals were the top hiring channel&lt;/strong&gt;.
The second best channel was a bit of a surprise with local meetups and local communities being very high in a majority of interviews
although this was less true among the largest companies we talked to.
Companies also had some success with recruiting at conferences, using various job sites, and proactive outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring managers shared strategies with us that they used to increase the number of referral and community candidates they got.
Two different companies we talked to hosted multiple local meetups at their offices and one of those hiring managers said
“being plugged into the community” was their main channel for hiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hiring manager who focused a lot on developers with security experience talked about having “LinkedIn parties”
where either a hiring manager or internal recruiter sat with engineers on their team one-on-one to go through their LinkedIn network.
Even when he heard a person “is great, but they’ll never change jobs”, that was a good candidate to target.
Security is such a high demand field, he said, that very few great people are actively looking for a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Job seeker timeline&quot; src=&quot;img/2019-job-seeker-timeline.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;reaching-people-who-aren-t-looking-is-critical&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reaching people who aren’t looking is critical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our biggest takeaways from the interviews was that companies wanted to reach candidates before they started actively looking.
Most of the hiring managers we talked to stressed the importance of getting in front of passive candidates.
Certainly fewer people are actively looking for developer jobs than those who are just open to a change.
A few different reasons were given but I actually think &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/magazine/20070501/column-guest.html&quot;&gt;Joel Spolsky had it right&lt;/a&gt; when he said
top developers “barely ever apply for jobs at all. That’s because they already have jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote isn’t necessarily a slight against people who apply actively to jobs.
Virtually everyone I know in tech started their career applying to a job.
Rather, the message here is that as a developer becomes a mid-level developer
and then becomes a senior developer, they are more likely to rely on their network
to somewhat passively job seek rather than going through the front door
and simply applying on a company website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching people who aren’t actively looking is one area where Read the Docs can really help.
Companies want to reach them when they are just thinking about a new job or perhaps passively seeking.
Developers who come to our site are actively building software, not job-seeking.
Many of them are content at their current position.
For those that aren’t, this is a perfect place to showcase great companies
and help Read the Docs’ visitors to find their next job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;recruiters-can-be-worth-it&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recruiters can be worth it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each interview, we asked whether the company used recruiters or recruiting related services (eg. Hired, Triplebyte).
Universally, hiring managers brought up how expensive recruiters are,
but most of the people we talked to who had actually used recruiters in the past had a positive impression overall.
Hiring takes a ton of time, typically from senior folks at the company.
At smaller startups, that’s frequently the CEO or CTO.
Even though the price is high, recruiters who help speed that process along are worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the quote that really summed it up was from a VP of engineering at a startup that just raised a Series B.
He’s trying to grow his team by 10 developers this year (about a 50% increase).
His experience hiring his first couple developers through a 2-person boutique recruiting firm was great and
he would use them for hiring everyone “if hiring 10 people didn’t mean $100k+” in fees alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://triplebyte.com&quot;&gt;Triplebyte&lt;/a&gt; is an advertiser on Read the Docs. We’re fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;diversity-and-inclusivity-in-hiring&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diversity and inclusivity in hiring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t ask any questions around hiring for diversity
but fully six hiring managers volunteered information on their companies’ strategies
for getting more diverse candidates.
This is why I love this kind of interview where the goal is just to listen to what hiring managers say
and dig deeper when you hear something interesting.
Some of the larger companies we talked to had explicit diversity goals set at the company level.
Even among the hiring managers at smaller companies,
they shared some tactics they used to get more diverse candidates to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the companies with hard diversity goals, most of them told us that their strategy
entailed syndicating their job openings to diversity focused jobs sites
or in some cases engaging directly with relevant interest groups.
In terms of efficacy, reviews of these various jobs boards was mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the more positive side, hiring managers cited
Girl Develop It, Black Girls Code, and PyLadies as fantastic channels
for &lt;strong&gt;both increasing candidate diversity and for high quality applicants&lt;/strong&gt;.
Two companies also talked about trying to decrease bias
in their job postings using &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://textio.com/&quot;&gt;Textio&lt;/a&gt; and similar services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having multiple people mention diversity completely unprompted really shows that this topic
is becoming higher priority for companies and hiring managers.
It also shows that it if hiring for diversity is important to your company,
you need to have a plan for actually making those goals a reality.
It’s worth checking whether the strategy actually works too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;remember-sourcing-is-the-bigger-problem&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remember, sourcing is the bigger problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single hiring manager we talked to complained about the time they spent filtering resumes from applicants.
Some choice quotes I heard included “95% of applicants weren’t a fit” even after only reviewing the resume
and a hiring manager who posted to a very popular remote-only job board told me he got “literally one thousand applications”.
While I believe this is a legitimate complaint,
I think &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.alinelerner.com/building-a-product-in-the-technical-recruiting-space-read-this-first/&quot;&gt;Aline Lerner, founder of interviewing.io said it best&lt;/a&gt;
when she said “Engineering hiring isn’t a filtering problem. It’s a sourcing problem.”
The reason we heard it a lot is that filtering is a very time-consuming task that hiring managers directly deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real problem here is that &lt;strong&gt;the number of applicants to a job post is a vanity metric&lt;/strong&gt;.
What hiring managers are looking for is qualified applicants, which is harder to gauge without some additional work.
One of the problems here is that a lot of jobs sites make it really easy for candidates to apply to lots of jobs.
This is understandable from their perspective as more applicants makes their platform seem more valuable.
There’s no reason for a job board to put artificial barriers into the application funnel,
but hiring managers told us they want candidates who want to work for their company
not somebody who is applying to every job out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of building product here, I think hiring managers just need a few tweaks
to get more of a signal of candidate quality and intent in their applications.
A few of the hiring managers we talked to described how they did this.
Multiple hiring managers mentioned how they required a cover letter that answered specific questions (“why us” was the most popular).
Another hiring manager described how his hiring system just asked a few short questions of candidates
– for example, “what is the software project you’re most proud of” – when they applied.
When a candidate didn’t do a cover letter or didn’t answer the questions, they weren’t considered.
The latter solution seemed like the best of both worlds as it solves the one-click apply problem without being too much of a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;thanks&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank all the hiring managers who took time out of their days (or in some cases evenings) to talk to us.

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;tips-to-hire-developers-with-read-the-docs&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs is probably not the first place you think of if you are recruiting.
However, over &lt;strong&gt;7 million unique developers use Read the Docs each month&lt;/strong&gt; from all over the world.
We didn’t set out to build a better job board,
but after a number of advertisers used our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advertising/ethical-advertising.html&quot;&gt;ethical ads&lt;/a&gt; for recruiting,
we discovered that Read the Docs was a great place to find developer talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;hiring-with-read-the-docs-works&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hiring with Read the Docs works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers are not always actively job seeking
by browsing job boards or company careers pages.
However, they are on Read the Docs reading about the libraries and frameworks they use.
Even when people aren’t actively looking for a new job,
many are open to exploring new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Read the Docs, we found that developers engage with hiring ads
at a higher rate than any other kind of advertising.
With hiring ads, developers get ads that are relevant and interesting
and companies reach the folks actively using the tech they are recruiting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Click-through rate by ad type Q3 2018&quot; src=&quot;img/2018-ctr-adtype.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;be-specific-and-find-the-right-developers&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be specific and find the right developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for Python developers,
you can configure your hiring ad to only show on Python related documentation.
You can further refine your audience to Read the Docs visitors in specific regions.
Whether you are looking for a remote Python data scientist or a blockchain developer in Switzerland,
be as specific as possible.
This ensures you don’t get unqualified candidates
as well as making sure you catch the eyes of the people you are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;set-the-right-expectations&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Set the right expectations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any type of advertising, setting appropriate expectations can make the difference
between a lackluster and successful campaign. In hiring, it is even more critical.
This means making sure that your hiring ad for a front-end JavaScript developer
links directly to your JavaScript developer job listing page where people can click “apply”.
Don’t link to a listing of all of your open positions unless your hiring ad sets that expectation.
Nothing is worse for the developer than clicking on a hiring ad
and not knowing what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, some things can set the wrong kind of expectation.
Most developers have seen enough hiring posts for “rockstars” and “ninjas” to know what to expect.
Be honest and upfront and you will attract the right folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;stand-out&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stand out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers get contacted all the time by recruiters
and it can be difficult to show prospective employees why they should check out your company.
People look for all sorts of different things when seeking a new job
from working with a high-caliber team to working for a company whose goals they agree with.
You should highlight your best selling points right on your hiring ad as early as possible.
If your company affords a fantastic work/life balance, mention that.
A company in a great location, with a beautiful office, and top of the line hardware
should definitely feature that.
Focusing on your best attributes shows you care about your developers
and helps you appeal to people who care about your products and mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advertising/ethical-advertising.html&quot;&gt;ethical advertising&lt;/a&gt; model,
Read the Docs &lt;strong&gt;gives away&lt;/strong&gt; 10% of our ad inventory
to projects, conferences, and other initiatives in the open source community.
Many of these projects operate as Read the Docs did in the past with little to no income.
These are not groups that traditionally have the resources to use paid advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have run ads for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various Python conferences from &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://us.pycon.org/&quot;&gt;PyCon&lt;/a&gt; to smaller regional conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many topic or framework specific conferences such as &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://djangocon.us/&quot;&gt;Djangocon US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://sustainoss.org/&quot;&gt;Sustain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.python.org/psf/&quot;&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pybee.org/&quot;&gt;Beeware&lt;/a&gt; - tools and libraries for building native apps in Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/godotengine&quot;&gt;Godot&lt;/a&gt; - an open source game engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://kiwitcms.org/&quot;&gt;Kiwi TCMS&lt;/a&gt; - an open source test case management system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://worldpossible.org/&quot;&gt;World Possible&lt;/a&gt; - an education non-profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.writethedocs.org/&quot;&gt;Write the Docs&lt;/a&gt; - a series of events for documentatarians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;get-in-touch-we-can-help&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get in touch. We can help!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run a conference, non-profit, or a funding strapped open source project,
we would love to help you get the word out.
Make sure you qualify for our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advertising/ethical-advertising.html#community-ads&quot;&gt;community ads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:ads&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;readthedocs&amp;#46;org&quot;&gt;send us an email&lt;/a&gt;
to be considered for the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any feedback about our community advertising program,
we’d love to hear from you too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="text">Do Not Track at Read the Docs</title>

    <updated>2018-06-08T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;do-not-track-at-read-the-docs&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we are pleased to announce that Read the Docs honors &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://allaboutdnt.com/&quot;&gt;Do Not Track&lt;/a&gt; (DNT).
DNT is a browser preference that requests that a user not be tracked
across the internet while browsing the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there isn’t a consensus on precisely what DNT should mean,
we are following the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s (EFF) &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;
for Do Not Track as we believe that gives a good balance
between the privacy expectations of users and the reality of running a business
and keeping Read the Docs sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-we-implemented&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we implemented&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much needed to change to make Read the Docs support DNT
and many of these changes were already necessary
for the EU’s new &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../gdpr-what-it-means-for-readthedocs/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;privacy regulation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a brief list of what we did for Do Not Track:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our logs that store any personal data are deleted after no more than ten days.
We do this for all users even those who don’t have DNT enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a user has DNT enabled, we do not send data to our analytics.
Based on our initial data, this looks like about a 6% reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While this didn’t change, we reiterated that we &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt;
do behavioral ad targeting regardless of DNT preference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full details on Do Not Track at Read the Docs can be found in our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/privacy-policy.html#do-not-track&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-dnt-means-for-our-advertising&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What DNT means for our advertising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising at Read the Docs was already built with privacy in mind.
With our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advertising/ethical-advertising.html&quot; title=&quot;(in Read the Docs v5.25.0)&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;xref std std-doc&quot;&gt;Ethical Ads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we previously committed to not tracking users,
not selling user data, and hosting ads ourselves
which all align perfectly with Do Not Track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our support for DNT formalizes our commitment to the high standards
for privacy produced by the EFF.
It also make us one of very few ad networks that honor Do Not Track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-ethical-ad-network&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Ethical Ad Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ethical-advertising-works/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
we mentioned that we are taking the same developer-centric, privacy-focused
advertising we have on Read the Docs and expanding this to a larger ad network
for open source infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting Do Not Track is an important milestone along the way
as it confirms our commitment to privacy in advertising.
We believe that ads don’t have to track people to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ethicalads.io/&quot;&gt;Ethical Ad network&lt;/a&gt; is still in its early stages,
but if you want to know more or you know a project that could use it,
please &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:ads&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;readthedocs&amp;#46;org&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;gdpr-what-it-means-for-read-the-docs&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your email inbox has probably been bombarded
over the last few days and weeks with “Updates to our Privacy Policy”.
These emails pertain to an EU law called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
which comes into effect today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the GDPR is to put users back in control of their data.
It is an important step toward respecting users’ privacy.
The days of collecting as much data on as many people as possible
without consent and sharing it with anyone willing to pay for it are over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-changed-at-read-the-docs&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What changed at Read the Docs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs takes privacy seriously (would any company publicly say otherwise) and
relatively little changed for us as a result of the GDPR.
We intentionally don’t collect much personal information and we only do it with consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we did use the GDPR as an excuse to get our data house in order so to speak.
Here are a few key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A brand new privacy policy&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Read the Docs added a new &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/privacy-policy.html&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;
that explains the data we collect, from which users we collect it, and why.
It enumerates third parties we use for various services and what data we share.
The policy also details the data we keep and when it is deleted.
Our goal was to make it easy to understand so please give it a read!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Privacy by default&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The GDPR mandates “data protection by design and by default”.
For us, this meant reducing the scope and duration of the logs and other data we keep.
We attempt to collect as little as possible from users merely browsing Read the Docs.
When we do collect data, such as when a user creates an account, we protect it.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;No difference for EU residents vs. everyone else&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Read the Docs applied the stricter protections mandated by the GDPR to all our users.
We believe that is the right thing to do. Creating two classes of users
and only protecting them when required by law just doesn’t seem right.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Read the Docs is committed to making sure we comply with the GDPR,
we aren’t just doing the minimum needed.
We are taking some additional steps to protect users which we will cover in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ethical-ads&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethical Ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably the GDPR is a response to pernicious &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/05/12/gdpr/&quot;&gt;privacy violations by advertising firms&lt;/a&gt;
so it makes sense to discuss the advertising we show on Read the Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Read the Docs is an ad-supported website,
we didn’t need to make any changes to our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html&quot;&gt;Ethical Ads&lt;/a&gt; to comply with the GDPR.
That’s because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our advertising is &lt;strong&gt;well-targeted without being personal&lt;/strong&gt;.
We ensure our ads are relevant by keeping them developer focused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethical Ads are &lt;strong&gt;hosted by Read the Docs&lt;/strong&gt;, not advertisers or a third party network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;don’t share personal data&lt;/strong&gt; with advertisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By enforcing privacy by default, the GDPR shifts the discussion on advertising.
We want to create an advertising model that is a win for all parties especially users.
We know from our experience that &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ethical-advertising-works/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;ethical advertising works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
It is possible to make money without giving away your users data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about Ethical Ads at Read the Docs, please &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:ads&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;readthedocs&amp;#46;org&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;system-message&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;system-message-title&quot;&gt;System Message: INFO/1 (&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;/Users/lienxiong/workspace/blog/gdpr-what-it-means-for-readthedocs.rst&lt;/tt&gt;, line 78); &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#id1&quot;&gt;backlink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Duplicate implicit target name: “ethical ads”.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title type="text">Update on Ad Blocking and Acceptable Ads</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;update-on-ad-blocking-and-acceptable-ads&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we shared about the
&lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ads-and-adblocking/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;challenge ad blocking presented to our sustainability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and what we were doing about it.
On May 4th, Read the Docs was added to the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://acceptableads.com/&quot;&gt;Acceptable Ads list&lt;/a&gt;
meaning that our visitors running ad blockers who choose to allow unintrusive advertising
will see our ads again.
The &lt;strong&gt;impact to our ad views, clicks, and revenue was immediate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;data-on-our-inclusion-in-the-acceptable-ads-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data on our inclusion in the Acceptable Ads list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Impact of ad blocking and acceptable ads at Read the Docs&quot; src=&quot;img/2018-readthedocs-adblocker-update.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;32% of Read the Docs visitors run an ad blocker&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Estimates around the web vary regarding what percentage of people
run ad blockers and it varies heavily by industry.
We discussed this figure a bit in our &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ads-and-adblocking/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;It took a month from application to inclusion in the list&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered about our inclusion in the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://easylist.to/&quot;&gt;EasyList&lt;/a&gt; ad blocker list
within a couple days and immediately applied to the Acceptable Ads program.
No changes were required of us to meet the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://acceptableads.com/en/about/criteria&quot;&gt;Acceptable Ads criteria&lt;/a&gt;
and we also qualified for &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads#privacy-friendly-acceptable-ads&quot;&gt;Acceptable Ads without third-party tracking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Eyeo, the company behind AdBlock Plus,
derives &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/about#monetization&quot;&gt;most of their revenue&lt;/a&gt; from the Acceptable Ads initiative
by charging large entities,
Read the Docs &lt;strong&gt;did not&lt;/strong&gt; pay for inclusion on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Over half of those running an ad blocker allow acceptable ads&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Given our more tech-savvy and privacy-focused audience,
we didn’t know what to expect.
Not every ad blocker allows acceptable ads by default
and even then users can choose to turn them off.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;People running ad blockers DO click on ads&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We can definitively say this is true of our audience.
Our click-through rate did not change based on ad blocking or
our inclusion in the acceptable ads list at all.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the ad views and clicks blocked by ad blockers,
inclusion in the Acceptable Ads list meant that 55-60%
of our ad-blocking visitors choose to allow our ads.
This directly translated into revenue toward our sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;building-our-ethical-ads&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building our Ethical Ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Acceptable Ads list is definitely a step in the right direction for us.
We share the goal of unintrusive advertising that respects our audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People understand that advertising funds much of the web.
As ads got larger, more annoying,
and ad networks stored more information on millions of people, however,
many people finally decided to install ad blockers.
This is the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-graph/how-to-reverse-publisher-revenue-drain-c33e41bf0665&quot;&gt;largest boycott in human history&lt;/a&gt; and blaming users isn’t the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our experience with ad blocking and the Acceptable Ads list,
it is clear that visitors will allow advertising that doesn’t disrupt user experience
and doesn’t track people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are glad to have made progress toward regaining our sustaining revenue.
Read the Docs is continuing on our experiment to fund open source infrastructure
in a way that is a win/win for all parties,
and we are glad you’re following along with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
