&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: The migration was successful and the site has been fully restored as of 4PM PST.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to make you aware that on Friday, February 12th at 1pm PST (4pm EST, 21:00 UTC),
Read the Docs Community (readthedocs.org) will be having a &lt;strong&gt;scheduled dashboard downtime of approximately 4 hours&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure minimal impact for our users,
we are performing this upgrade during a Friday afternoon
which is one of our lowest usage periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this maintenance window, &lt;strong&gt;documentation will continue to be online&lt;/strong&gt;
but new documentation builds will not trigger and the Read the Docs dashboard will be unavailable.
New builds and webhooks will begin processing once the maintenance is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are moving our service to our new home on Amazon Web Services
who have generously provided us with credits to support open source software.
This is the same platform which Read the Docs for Business is hosted,
which will allow us to reuse a lot of the same code between the sites.
This should simplify our operations considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d like to thank Microsoft Azure for sponsoring our hosting for the past 2.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your understanding of this maintenance downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: This maintenance window has concluded at 5:40 PM PST.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to make you aware that on Friday, February 5 at 5:00pm PST (8:00pm EST, Saturday 01:00 UTC),
Read the Docs for Business (readthedocs.com) will be having a &lt;strong&gt;scheduled downtime of approximately 2 hours&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this maintenance window, &lt;strong&gt;documentation will continue to be online&lt;/strong&gt; but new documentation builds will not trigger and the Read the Docs dashboard will be unavailable. New builds and webhooks will begin processing once the maintenance is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure minimal impact for our users, we are performing this upgrade during a Friday afternoon which is one of our lowest usage periods. This maintenance window is for a required database version upgrade which we couldn’t perform in place. While these kinds of things do happen from time to time, we haven’t had a scheduled downtime on Read the Docs for Business in a few years. Doing this helps us ensure that our services perform well and have up-to-date security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your understanding of this maintenance downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
