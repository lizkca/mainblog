&lt;p&gt;Today, we are pleased to announce that Read the Docs honors &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://allaboutdnt.com/&quot;&gt;Do Not Track&lt;/a&gt; (DNT).
DNT is a browser preference that requests that a user not be tracked
across the internet while browsing the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there isn’t a consensus on precisely what DNT should mean,
we are following the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s (EFF) &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;
for Do Not Track as we believe that gives a good balance
between the privacy expectations of users and the reality of running a business
and keeping Read the Docs sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-we-implemented&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we implemented&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much needed to change to make Read the Docs support DNT
and many of these changes were already necessary
for the EU’s new &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../gdpr-what-it-means-for-readthedocs/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;privacy regulation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a brief list of what we did for Do Not Track:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our logs that store any personal data are deleted after no more than ten days.
We do this for all users even those who don’t have DNT enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a user has DNT enabled, we do not send data to our analytics.
Based on our initial data, this looks like about a 6% reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While this didn’t change, we reiterated that we &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt;
do behavioral ad targeting regardless of DNT preference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full details on Do Not Track at Read the Docs can be found in our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/privacy-policy.html#do-not-track&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-dnt-means-for-our-advertising&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What DNT means for our advertising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising at Read the Docs was already built with privacy in mind.
With our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advertising/ethical-advertising.html&quot; title=&quot;(in Read the Docs v5.25.0)&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;xref std std-doc&quot;&gt;Ethical Ads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we previously committed to not tracking users,
not selling user data, and hosting ads ourselves
which all align perfectly with Do Not Track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our support for DNT formalizes our commitment to the high standards
for privacy produced by the EFF.
It also make us one of very few ad networks that honor Do Not Track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-ethical-ad-network&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Ethical Ad Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ethical-advertising-works/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
we mentioned that we are taking the same developer-centric, privacy-focused
advertising we have on Read the Docs and expanding this to a larger ad network
for open source infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting Do Not Track is an important milestone along the way
as it confirms our commitment to privacy in advertising.
We believe that ads don’t have to track people to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ethicalads.io/&quot;&gt;Ethical Ad network&lt;/a&gt; is still in its early stages,
but if you want to know more or you know a project that could use it,

&lt;p&gt;Your email inbox has probably been bombarded
over the last few days and weeks with “Updates to our Privacy Policy”.
These emails pertain to an EU law called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
which comes into effect today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the GDPR is to put users back in control of their data.
It is an important step toward respecting users’ privacy.
The days of collecting as much data on as many people as possible
without consent and sharing it with anyone willing to pay for it are over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-changed-at-read-the-docs&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What changed at Read the Docs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs takes privacy seriously (would any company publicly say otherwise) and
relatively little changed for us as a result of the GDPR.
We intentionally don’t collect much personal information and we only do it with consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we did use the GDPR as an excuse to get our data house in order so to speak.
Here are a few key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A brand new privacy policy&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Read the Docs added a new &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/privacy-policy.html&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;
that explains the data we collect, from which users we collect it, and why.
It enumerates third parties we use for various services and what data we share.
The policy also details the data we keep and when it is deleted.
Our goal was to make it easy to understand so please give it a read!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Privacy by default&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The GDPR mandates “data protection by design and by default”.
For us, this meant reducing the scope and duration of the logs and other data we keep.
We attempt to collect as little as possible from users merely browsing Read the Docs.
When we do collect data, such as when a user creates an account, we protect it.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;No difference for EU residents vs. everyone else&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Read the Docs applied the stricter protections mandated by the GDPR to all our users.
We believe that is the right thing to do. Creating two classes of users
and only protecting them when required by law just doesn’t seem right.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Read the Docs is committed to making sure we comply with the GDPR,
we aren’t just doing the minimum needed.
We are taking some additional steps to protect users which we will cover in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ethical-ads&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethical Ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably the GDPR is a response to pernicious &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/05/12/gdpr/&quot;&gt;privacy violations by advertising firms&lt;/a&gt;
so it makes sense to discuss the advertising we show on Read the Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Read the Docs is an ad-supported website,
we didn’t need to make any changes to our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html&quot;&gt;Ethical Ads&lt;/a&gt; to comply with the GDPR.
That’s because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our advertising is &lt;strong&gt;well-targeted without being personal&lt;/strong&gt;.
We ensure our ads are relevant by keeping them developer focused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethical Ads are &lt;strong&gt;hosted by Read the Docs&lt;/strong&gt;, not advertisers or a third party network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;don’t share personal data&lt;/strong&gt; with advertisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By enforcing privacy by default, the GDPR shifts the discussion on advertising.
We want to create an advertising model that is a win for all parties especially users.
We know from our experience that &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ethical-advertising-works/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;ethical advertising works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
It is possible to make money without giving away your users data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about Ethical Ads at Read the Docs, please &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:ads&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;readthedocs&amp;#46;org&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;system-message&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;system-message-title&quot;&gt;System Message: INFO/1 (&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;/Users/lienxiong/workspace/blog/gdpr-what-it-means-for-readthedocs.rst&lt;/tt&gt;, line 78); &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#id1&quot;&gt;backlink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Duplicate implicit target name: “ethical ads”.&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ads-and-ad-blockers&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time, we shared how &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ethical-advertising-works/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;ethical advertising works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
to keep Read the Docs sustainable without creepy ad targeting.
This time, we will share about one of our biggest challenges with advertising.
At the beginning of April, Read the Docs was added to one of the most popular
ad block lists: the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://easylist.to/&quot;&gt;Easylist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ad-blocker-fallout&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ad blocker fallout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Effect of ad blocking on Read the Docs ad views&quot; src=&quot;img/2018-readthedocs-adblocker-fallout.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting added to the EasyList had a significant and immediate impact
on the bottom line at Read the Docs.
Right around April 1, &lt;strong&gt;32% of our ad views simply vanished&lt;/strong&gt;.
At first, we thought we had done something horribly wrong
but then we discovered that this was due entirely to ad blocking.
Our actual traffic wasn’t down at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users’ browsers were simply downloading the updated EasyList
which blocked ads on Read the Docs.
In terms of ad viewership, weekdays
– our busiest days and the peaks in the graph –
became more like weekends and weekends fell off a cliff.
We had always guessed what percentage of our user base ran ad blockers.
Now we know. We knew this day would come as we became more successful
but we had hoped it was a ways off considering we weren’t part of a large ad network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This directly affected our operations and staff.
Our operating costs didn’t go down in any significant way, but revenue sure did.
Advertising is by far the largest source of revenue at Read the Docs
and it just dropped by about a third.
This meant that we had to cut some costs where we could and slow down some hiring plans.
While Read the Docs is not a non-profit company,
all the revenue is reinvested into the project itself, paying maintainers,
and other places in the open source ecosystem.
The situation is not dire by any means,
but it was certainly disappointing that we ended up on the same list
with popup advertisers who couldn’t care less about privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;all-about-ad-blockers&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All about ad blockers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad blockers fulfill a legitimate need to mitigate the
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html#ethical-info&quot;&gt;significant downsides of advertising&lt;/a&gt; from tracking across the internet,
security implications of third-party code,
and impacting the UX and performance of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Read the Docs, we specifically didn’t want those things.
That’s why we built the ad network we wanted to exist with
only relevant ads and no creepy behavioral targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagefair.com/downloads/2017/01/PageFair-2017-Adblock-Report.pdf&quot;&gt;2017 report from PageFair&lt;/a&gt; (pdf),
a company that specializes in quantifying ad blocking,
11% of global web users run an ad blocker.
Considering that Read the Docs’ core audience is tech-savvy,
privacy-conscious developers,
it should be no surprise that our number is higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-are-we-doing-about-it&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are we doing about it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an uphill battle to get back to where we were in terms of revenue
and sustaining Read the Docs, here are a few things we are working on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We applied to the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://acceptableads.com/&quot;&gt;acceptable ads&lt;/a&gt; list,
an ad block list enabled on many ad blockers by default
that enables some unobtrusive advertising.
We are very hopeful here but it does take quite a bit longer
to get on this list than it does to get blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nagging users into allowing ads on Read the Docs.
We are envisioning more of a polite nag in a similar vein to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://jsfiddle.net/&quot;&gt;jsfiddle&lt;/a&gt;
rather than an “adblock wall” which prevents usage of Read the Docs
until it’s allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogging and raising awareness of how ad blocking affects us and other
open source projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we could simply change our CSS and ad API to avoid blocking
since we host our ads ourselves,  we decided not to engage in a cat and mouse game
since this work would not benefit users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising funds much of the web and many people recognize
that while there are plenty of bad actors in the ad industry
– think pop-under ad networks or ads that navigate your browser for you –
some advertising is necessary to power the web we know and love
especially when it comes to open source software which has
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;unique funding challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: On May 4th, Read the Docs was added to the acceptable ads list!
We will collect data over the next couple weeks and have a follow-up post
on what effects this had on advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;open-source-advertising-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open source advertising list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Read the Docs, we also discovered that we are not the only open source project
that got our advertising blocked by ad blockers.
Many open source projects that fund themselves
through advertising get blocked
and some of them don’t have the resources to navigate the acceptable ads program
or understand the inner workings of ad blockers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, some web users may not want to allow all acceptable ads
which includes many ads from the big networks but we are hoping they would be
willing to accept ads that benefit their community of software developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are launching a &lt;strong&gt;new initiative&lt;/strong&gt; to
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://ads-for-open-source.readthedocs.io&quot;&gt;allow advertising that benefits open source software&lt;/a&gt;. We encourage
you to subscribe to the this list and support open source.
If you run an open source project affected by ad blockers, we would love to help you too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonition-advertisers admonition&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;first admonition-title&quot;&gt;Advertisers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;last&quot;&gt;If you are an advertiser interested in reaching a 100% developer
audience who cares deeply about privacy,
we would love to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://readthedocs.org/sustainability/advertising/&quot;&gt;hear from you&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
