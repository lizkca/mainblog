&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we shared about the
&lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ads-and-adblocking/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;challenge ad blocking presented to our sustainability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and what we were doing about it.
On May 4th, Read the Docs was added to the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://acceptableads.com/&quot;&gt;Acceptable Ads list&lt;/a&gt;
meaning that our visitors running ad blockers who choose to allow unintrusive advertising
will see our ads again.
The &lt;strong&gt;impact to our ad views, clicks, and revenue was immediate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;data-on-our-inclusion-in-the-acceptable-ads-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data on our inclusion in the Acceptable Ads list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Impact of ad blocking and acceptable ads at Read the Docs&quot; src=&quot;img/2018-readthedocs-adblocker-update.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;32% of Read the Docs visitors run an ad blocker&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Estimates around the web vary regarding what percentage of people
run ad blockers and it varies heavily by industry.
We discussed this figure a bit in our &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ads-and-adblocking/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;It took a month from application to inclusion in the list&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered about our inclusion in the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://easylist.to/&quot;&gt;EasyList&lt;/a&gt; ad blocker list
within a couple days and immediately applied to the Acceptable Ads program.
No changes were required of us to meet the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://acceptableads.com/en/about/criteria&quot;&gt;Acceptable Ads criteria&lt;/a&gt;
and we also qualified for &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads#privacy-friendly-acceptable-ads&quot;&gt;Acceptable Ads without third-party tracking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Eyeo, the company behind AdBlock Plus,
derives &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/about#monetization&quot;&gt;most of their revenue&lt;/a&gt; from the Acceptable Ads initiative
by charging large entities,
Read the Docs &lt;strong&gt;did not&lt;/strong&gt; pay for inclusion on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Over half of those running an ad blocker allow acceptable ads&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Given our more tech-savvy and privacy-focused audience,
we didn’t know what to expect.
Not every ad blocker allows acceptable ads by default
and even then users can choose to turn them off.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;People running ad blockers DO click on ads&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We can definitively say this is true of our audience.
Our click-through rate did not change based on ad blocking or
our inclusion in the acceptable ads list at all.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the ad views and clicks blocked by ad blockers,
inclusion in the Acceptable Ads list meant that 55-60%
of our ad-blocking visitors choose to allow our ads.
This directly translated into revenue toward our sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;building-our-ethical-ads&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building our Ethical Ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Acceptable Ads list is definitely a step in the right direction for us.
We share the goal of unintrusive advertising that respects our audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People understand that advertising funds much of the web.
As ads got larger, more annoying,
and ad networks stored more information on millions of people, however,
many people finally decided to install ad blockers.
This is the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-graph/how-to-reverse-publisher-revenue-drain-c33e41bf0665&quot;&gt;largest boycott in human history&lt;/a&gt; and blaming users isn’t the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our experience with ad blocking and the Acceptable Ads list,
it is clear that visitors will allow advertising that doesn’t disrupt user experience
and doesn’t track people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are glad to have made progress toward regaining our sustaining revenue.
Read the Docs is continuing on our experiment to fund open source infrastructure
in a way that is a win/win for all parties,
and we are glad you’re following along with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time, we shared how &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../../ethical-advertising-works/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;ethical advertising works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
to keep Read the Docs sustainable without creepy ad targeting.
This time, we will share about one of our biggest challenges with advertising.
At the beginning of April, Read the Docs was added to one of the most popular
ad block lists: the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://easylist.to/&quot;&gt;Easylist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ad-blocker-fallout&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ad blocker fallout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Effect of ad blocking on Read the Docs ad views&quot; src=&quot;img/2018-readthedocs-adblocker-fallout.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting added to the EasyList had a significant and immediate impact
on the bottom line at Read the Docs.
Right around April 1, &lt;strong&gt;32% of our ad views simply vanished&lt;/strong&gt;.
At first, we thought we had done something horribly wrong
but then we discovered that this was due entirely to ad blocking.
Our actual traffic wasn’t down at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users’ browsers were simply downloading the updated EasyList
which blocked ads on Read the Docs.
In terms of ad viewership, weekdays
– our busiest days and the peaks in the graph –
became more like weekends and weekends fell off a cliff.
We had always guessed what percentage of our user base ran ad blockers.
Now we know. We knew this day would come as we became more successful
but we had hoped it was a ways off considering we weren’t part of a large ad network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This directly affected our operations and staff.
Our operating costs didn’t go down in any significant way, but revenue sure did.
Advertising is by far the largest source of revenue at Read the Docs
and it just dropped by about a third.
This meant that we had to cut some costs where we could and slow down some hiring plans.
While Read the Docs is not a non-profit company,
all the revenue is reinvested into the project itself, paying maintainers,
and other places in the open source ecosystem.
The situation is not dire by any means,
but it was certainly disappointing that we ended up on the same list
with popup advertisers who couldn’t care less about privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;all-about-ad-blockers&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All about ad blockers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad blockers fulfill a legitimate need to mitigate the
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html#ethical-info&quot;&gt;significant downsides of advertising&lt;/a&gt; from tracking across the internet,
security implications of third-party code,
and impacting the UX and performance of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Read the Docs, we specifically didn’t want those things.
That’s why we built the ad network we wanted to exist with
only relevant ads and no creepy behavioral targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagefair.com/downloads/2017/01/PageFair-2017-Adblock-Report.pdf&quot;&gt;2017 report from PageFair&lt;/a&gt; (pdf),
a company that specializes in quantifying ad blocking,
11% of global web users run an ad blocker.
Considering that Read the Docs’ core audience is tech-savvy,
privacy-conscious developers,
it should be no surprise that our number is higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-are-we-doing-about-it&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are we doing about it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an uphill battle to get back to where we were in terms of revenue
and sustaining Read the Docs, here are a few things we are working on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We applied to the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://acceptableads.com/&quot;&gt;acceptable ads&lt;/a&gt; list,
an ad block list enabled on many ad blockers by default
that enables some unobtrusive advertising.
We are very hopeful here but it does take quite a bit longer
to get on this list than it does to get blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nagging users into allowing ads on Read the Docs.
We are envisioning more of a polite nag in a similar vein to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://jsfiddle.net/&quot;&gt;jsfiddle&lt;/a&gt;
rather than an “adblock wall” which prevents usage of Read the Docs
until it’s allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogging and raising awareness of how ad blocking affects us and other
open source projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we could simply change our CSS and ad API to avoid blocking
since we host our ads ourselves,  we decided not to engage in a cat and mouse game
since this work would not benefit users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising funds much of the web and many people recognize
that while there are plenty of bad actors in the ad industry
– think pop-under ad networks or ads that navigate your browser for you –
some advertising is necessary to power the web we know and love
especially when it comes to open source software which has
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;unique funding challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: On May 4th, Read the Docs was added to the acceptable ads list!
We will collect data over the next couple weeks and have a follow-up post
on what effects this had on advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;open-source-advertising-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open source advertising list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Read the Docs, we also discovered that we are not the only open source project
that got our advertising blocked by ad blockers.
Many open source projects that fund themselves
through advertising get blocked
and some of them don’t have the resources to navigate the acceptable ads program
or understand the inner workings of ad blockers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, some web users may not want to allow all acceptable ads
which includes many ads from the big networks but we are hoping they would be
willing to accept ads that benefit their community of software developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are launching a &lt;strong&gt;new initiative&lt;/strong&gt; to
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://ads-for-open-source.readthedocs.io&quot;&gt;allow advertising that benefits open source software&lt;/a&gt;. We encourage
you to subscribe to the this list and support open source.
If you run an open source project affected by ad blockers, we would love to help you too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;first admonition-title&quot;&gt;Advertisers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;last&quot;&gt;If you are an advertiser interested in reaching a 100% developer
audience who cares deeply about privacy,
we would love to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://readthedocs.org/sustainability/advertising/&quot;&gt;hear from you&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
