&lt;p&gt;Several months back, Mozilla launched a new initiative – the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS&quot;&gt;MOSS&lt;/a&gt; program –
to provide financial support to the open source software projects it relies on.
Mozilla allocated $1 million to the MOSS fund to provide grants for up to 10
projects matching the program’s criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs is among the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/12/10/mozilla-open-source-support-first-awards-made/&quot;&gt;first round of awards&lt;/a&gt; made for the MOSS program.
Our proposed grant, for $48,000, is to build a separate instance that integrates
with the Python Package Index’s upcoming website, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://warehouse.python.org/&quot;&gt;Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;. This integration
will provide automatic API reference documentation upon package release, with
authentication tied to PyPI and simple configuration inside the distribution.
API reference documentation on every release will be the starting point of this
work, prose documentation generation will be more difficult here, as not all
packages use Sphinx or rST for documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having consistent API reference documentation across all released distributions
will be an enormous benefit to the Python ecosystem. API reference documentation
will be found in a single space, with version specificity, and will be able to
be tightly inter-linked across projects. This is hopefully the start of work
that could benefit other communities as well, by putting more emphasis on usable
documentation and best documentation practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently just into the planning stage for this work. We hope to have an
official roadmap planned out, and a detailed breakdown of the work involved, in
the coming weeks. This post will be followed up with a more detailed look at our
plan and the work required. Work on this grant will hopefully begin early in the
new year and will be spaced out throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding open source software communities is still a difficult proposition for
most companies. We appreciate Mozilla’s stance and commitment to open source and
can only hope more companies take note and learn how to put value on the health
of the communities they rely on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <name>Eric Holscher</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;read-the-docs-sphinx-now-support-commonmark&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs is built on top of Sphinx,
which has always relied on reStructuredText as an input mechanism.
We have long heard from folks that they want to write documentation in Markdown,
as well as RST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are announcing that this is now possible!
With the standardization of Markdown into &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://commonmark.org/&quot;&gt;Commonmark&lt;/a&gt;,
we have the ability to support a markup language with a proper spec.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/recommonmark&quot;&gt;recommonmark&lt;/a&gt; is the bridge that allows Commonmark to be used inside Sphinx.
&lt;strong&gt;This allows you to use both RST and Commonmark inside of your Sphinx project.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;get-started&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have documented how to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html#using-markdown-with-sphinx&quot; title=&quot;(in Read the Docs v5.25.0)&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;xref std std-ref&quot;&gt;get started&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with Commonmark inside of Sphinx.
You simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight-default notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;recommonmark&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in your &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;conf.py&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight-python notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;recommonmark.parser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CommonMarkParser&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source_parsers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;.md&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CommonMarkParser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source_suffix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;.rst&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;.md&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows you to write both &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;.md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;.rst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; files inside of the same project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;example-project&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see this in action in my &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/ericholscher/sphinx-markdown-test&quot;&gt;sphinx-markdown-test repo&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.
You can also see a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://sphinx-markdown-test.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;rendered version&lt;/a&gt; hosted on Read the Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this project works is that it allows Commonmark files to be parsed into &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/doctree.html&quot;&gt;docutils nodes&lt;/a&gt;.
That means that everything downstream of the parser works the same as if the content came from RST.
This allows the content to slot into Sphinx and other RST based tools without much effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some caveats where certain Sphinx &amp;amp; docutils directives depend on the internal structure of RST.
We would like to eventually build a bridge from Commonmark to the Sphinx directives,
which would give a lot of the power of Sphinx to the Commonmark content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking at ways to handle this in the future,
and hope to eventually bring the full power of RST and Sphinx into the Commonmark ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that Commonmark doesn’t support a lot of the concepts that RST lets you represent.
In particular,
there is no standardized way in Commonmark to represent inline or block levels constructs.
So things like the &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;toctree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; directive and &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;:ref:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup don’t have an analog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://talk.commonmark.org/t/generic-directives-plugins-syntax/444&quot;&gt;proposed draft&lt;/a&gt; to the Commonmark spec to allow a similar syntax.
We are investigating adding support to this in recommonmark,
but we don’t want to implement a standard prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;intended-usage&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intended Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that Sphinx’s power to reference code and other programming concepts is quite powerful.
However,
all content doesn’t need this ability.
When you’re writing content that just needs to have basic text formatting and links,
Commonmark is a great option for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We imagine that API reference documentation will continue to be authored in RST for quite some time.
Also index pages and other reference heavy content will continue to be RST.
FAQ’s, blog posts, and other less reference heavy content is a great candidate for writing in Commonmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a new release,
so there are likely some missing pieces to our integration.
Go ahead and try it out.
Please file features ideas and bug reports on the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/recommonmark/issues&quot;&gt;recommonmark bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;securing-build-processes&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve recently introduced a new build container subsystem based on Docker to readthedocs.org,
which should go mostly unnoticed for users.
We’re still ironing out some bugs with the system,
so raise an issue on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues&quot;&gt;our issue tracker&lt;/a&gt; if you are noticing any new issues
with your project builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new system is part of an over-due security update to help isolate arbitrary
code execution.  As Read the Docs has grown, protecting against arbitrary
execution was a rapidly growing concern.  This build isolation layer was
developed as part of readthedocs.com, where security concerns are paramount due
to private repository access. We’ve been testing it for roll out on the
community site since then, but hadn’t committed to switching production build
servers over due to the number of possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This immediate change was in response to a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://alex.hyperiongray.com/posts/302352-pwn-the-docs&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; yesterday outlining some
possible attack vectors when dealing with arbitrary code execution and Python.
We didn’t want to delay the fix for any longer following this release, and
decided to deal with any lingering issues as soon as they came up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have no reason to believe that any users have been effected by the reported issue.
As a part of rolling out this new system,
we have provisioned new build servers.
We are also actively monitoring for any other possible issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How It Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new system,
we provision a unique container for each build.
All build steps that depend on executing code (setup.py, pip, Sphinx),
run inside that container as individual commands,
triggered from the host build server.
The container has 10 minutes to complete these build commands before we time out the
build and kill the container system.
A filesystem is shared from the host build server,
which only contains the project checkout and artifact directories.
The container has no other access to the build server filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our host build servers are firewalled from our application and database servers,
so they have no ability to connect to them.
Communication is done over a task queue on a dedicated server.
To start a build,
the web servers put a build task in a queue which is read by the build servers.
The host build servers manage the container creation,
command execution inside the container,
and the reporting of command and command return via our API.
When a build is finished,
a task is inserted into the queue,
and web servers pull documentation from the build server to be served.
All communication with the task queue and API happens outside of the container,
with the container strictly acting as a mechanism for command execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking out of this system requires a privilege escalation attack,
and the ability to break out of the container in order to access the outer build system.
All of these measures are required because our system runs user code.
To properly fix this situation,
we are working to remove arbitrary execution form our stack entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;fixing-arbitrary-execution&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixing Arbitrary Execution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitrary execution is something that is difficult, if not impossible, for us to
avoid currently. It’s built into Sphinx’s &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;autodoc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; system, which gives Sphinx such
a useful reference documentation implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, executing Python in order to evaluate docstrings is a broken pattern.
For our purposes, it requires installing project dependencies and executing the
code of each Python project on Read the Docs.  These are two steps that introduce a
substantial number of issues with usability and number of security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, using a project like &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Epydoc&lt;/a&gt; to help take place of &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;autodoc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; would
be the best path forward. This takes the approach of parsing the code, instead
of executing the code. This avoids executing the &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;setup.py&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; on the project,
and installing any dependencies, which is where code execution currently happens.
We’ve been working for some time now on supporting this with &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx-autoapi&quot;&gt;sphinx-autoapi&lt;/a&gt;,
but don’t think it’s an adequate solution for every Python project just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Epydoc is not a strong project for us to rely on currently, as
activity has winded down in the past years and it lacks Python 3 support.
Another project with the same focus is &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor/&quot;&gt;pydoctor&lt;/a&gt;,
though work to implement Python 3 support is required there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other source of code execution is the &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;conf.py&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; file inside Sphinx.
We have also been working on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs-build/pull/6&quot;&gt;readthedocs-build&lt;/a&gt;,
which implements a &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;readthedocs.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; file that will move Sphinx configuration
into a non-executable format.
This will remove the last step to remove arbitrary execution in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;for-more&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs is an open source project.
If you are interested in helping us with the above tasks,
we are always happy to have help.
Specifically if you are able to help with development of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx-autoapi&quot;&gt;sphinx-autoapi&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs-build/pull/6&quot;&gt;readthedocs-build&lt;/a&gt;,
that would greatly increase the speed that we can migrate to those solutions.
Also,
if you are knowledgeable in ways of locking Docker down even more,
we would love to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always,
you can email us at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:security&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;readthedocs&amp;#46;org&quot;&gt;security&lt;span&gt;&amp;#64;&lt;/span&gt;readthedocs&lt;span&gt;&amp;#46;&lt;/span&gt;org&lt;/a&gt; for any issues that might be security related.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;state-of-the-docs&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August has historical significance for Read the Docs, so it seemed fitting to
wrap up August by taking a moment to step back and reflect on what we’ve done in
the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What makes August so significant for us?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, this August saw the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://ericholscher.com/blog/2010/aug/16/announcing-read-docs/&quot;&gt;5th birthday of Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt;!
We’re still humbled by the project’s success, and the important role it
continues to play for old and new users alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This growth was becoming difficult to manage without focused support given back
to the community. Though the project has always had core maintainers, for Read
the Docs to continue growing as a community resource, we knew it required
dedicated attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reason why, in August of last year, Eric and I set out to create a
company around Read the Docs – another significant bookmark in Read the Docs’
history. We planned to build the company to fund the ongoing support efforts of
the community site and to help accelerate its growth. At this time last year, we
had just formed Read the Docs, Inc, we were fresh into the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://piepdx.com&quot;&gt;PIE accelerator
program&lt;/a&gt;, and we were planning how to bring our documentation values to
companies that weren’t open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-last-year&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The last year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our primary goal has always been to drive the development of our community site,
with hopes that it would one day be self-sustaining. We made a number of
decisions and changes to work towards this goal in the last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Treat the community site as a separate entity&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to be independently sustainable, the community site needs income of
its own. The service is large enough now that dedicated staff is a
necessity. There needs to be someone to drive development, handle support
requests, and be accountable for keeping everything running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, all money coming into Read the Docs is treated as income into the
business. We do track income to the community site separately, so we can
budget for the community site separately from running the rest of the
business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t yet to the point where this split is critical. There are no
employees of the business yet, and we are only able to pay ourselves for a
small portion of the work we perform for the community site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will need to track this explicitly as we grow however, as the community
site will need to rely on donations for the foreseeable future. Those
donations should not go towards developing the for-profit side directly.
Development of the community site will still be a primary function of income
into the for-profit side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the community site could be structured completely separate, to
provide a more explicit split.  It could probably be structured as a 501c,
This doesn’t make financial sense yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Our support fundraiser&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to fund development and maintenance on the community site, we
decided to call on our community for financial support back in June.  This
was the first time we have asked the community for contributions.  Our goal
was to fund at least a portion of the time spent developing and supporting
the community site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all the contributors from our community, we raised our goal of
$24,000, and were able to fund the time of multiple engineers working
steadily on Read the Docs for the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already outlined our costs and our plans behind our June fundraiser in a
previous post. We will be following up the last few months of work with an
overall review of the fundraiser and the work we performed in the coming
weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Triaging&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, our support responsiveness has been more apparent.  One hurdle in
bringing on more engineers, and engaging the community more, was the lack of
formal ticketing and open decision making.  Gregor, among many other
changes, laid out a formal triage process that has been a major influence in
keeping an organized and healthy support queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve definitely found that the more support engagement we provide the
community, the more support comes out of the woodwork.  This is all part of
supporting a healthy community however, as we have learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Stability&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Read the Docs has “grown organically”, which is to say it has grown fast,
unwieldy, and in many directions.  With more proper focus on code quality,
including clean up efforts, refactoring, and long due upgrades, Read the
Docs has shed considerable technical debt in the last couple months.  This
work has already paid off in improving stability and predictability of the
project.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Ads&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ran a few tests with advertising on built documentation in the last few
months.  We discussed at length how we felt about ads and determined our own
problems with the standard implementation of ads is not the ads themselves,
but the breach of privacy they signify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, we established that a requirement of us ever showing ads is
to not use third party tracking.  In fact, we look to remove all third party
tracking from built documentation as soon as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put ads into a clearer context, revenue from in-house ads fully cover our
costs each month, without asking the community for any further support. It
probably shouldn’t be surprising that advertising revenue is an easier
income source than seeking donations. We certainly feel Read the Docs
provides more value than the ads it would serve though. Our last fundraiser
reflected the value the community puts on the site, and we hope the next
fundraiser can be as successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we ever use ads as a primary revenue source for the community site,
we have established some rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will provide our ads in-house, not through any service that establishes
third party tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not sell any data about our users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will always prefer ad sponsorship from community members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users that support us through donations or sponsorship are opt out of ads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback regarding ads has been positive, hopefully our intentions with ads
has been mostly apparent. We’ll be discussing our thoughts on advertising in
more depth soon, if you have any feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Gold&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve begun working on a “gold” status feature for users that want to
support us each month. This will be an optional, recurring subscription to
Read the Docs. The subscription will provide some additional features for
users or projects, and some advanced project features might suggest a gold
subscription for projects that make use of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is still evolving, we’ll be asking for more feedback as this
feature matures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-next-year&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The next year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let us now set some expectations for the next year forward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Transparency and feedback&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating in the open has been an important tenant to our company since
formation.  We believe whole-heartedly in the trust and candid feedback it
provides, and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.opencompany.org/about/&quot;&gt;we have pledged&lt;/a&gt; to keep openness and transparency
at the core of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the structure that has guided us as a company has been providing
updates to those that we are accountable to. During our time at PIE, this
was to our mentors and our peers. Now, we want to be accountable to you, our
community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to continue the periodic updates that started with the
fundraiser, and we plan on releasing updates, on a quarterly basis, that
share more insights into the company.  We will continue to expose our goals,
problems, and decisions to you as we grow and we hope you can provide us
with your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Continued work towards stability&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We still have some technical debt that will take a while to pay off,
but ensuring stability is paramount to having a service we can all rely on.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Support responsiveness&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We will adhere as much as we can to the processes that we established around
our support channels. We hope that these processes will also allow others in
the community to easily fill these roles should we need the help.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for our technical goals, outside our roadmap and continued cleanup and
maintenance, here is what we have on our roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;User experience&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;With components becoming more stable, and a generally more stable code base,
we are shifting focus towards user experience – the pieces most obvious to
users. We’ve made some gains here in the past few months, but have a ways to
go still.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Easier documentation build tools&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Sphinx is an incredibly powerful tool, but for new users this can be
overwhelming. We are developing tooling to ease this process for new users
and provide a solid footing for the majority of use cases. This will also
help to make the build process more predictable, as this would mimic our
build backend processes closely.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;More reference doc language support&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We have been working towards wider language support for generating API
reference documentation. Most recently, we worked with Microsoft to develop
support for &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/sphinxcontrib-dotnetdomain&quot;&gt;.NET language support in Sphinx&lt;/a&gt;. This allows
authors to use existing .NET tooling to generate reStructuredText API
reference documentation.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;let-us-know&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let us know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any feedback or opinions on any of this, continue to let us know.
We’re happy to have the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;report-july-2015&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August was a hectic month for us. So busy, in fact, we never wrote this update.
We dropped the ball on getting this report out on time, but hope to keep on top
of future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July was a month of stability fixes, with some substantial changes to our
infrastructure. First, here’s an update on some of the goals we had set with
our last monthly update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Improve Github/Bitbucket integration&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;This got pushed to next month, we didn’t focus on this as much as we had
hoped.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Test internal analytics&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a basic testbed for internal analytics set up, but haven’t gone as
far as pushing this integration into production. We still need to test
production load and what the dataset would look like over the course of a
month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is on hold for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also set some additional goals near the beginning of the month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Finish rolling out a new stack&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our servers were all reasonably aged and have not been re-provisioned in a
long while. We set the goal to move all configuration to configuration
management and be able to reproduce servers in a predictable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to finish moving all provisioning to configuration management
and rolled out all new servers, including some new servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Improve monitoring&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have hit a lot of common cases that we should be tracking as part of our
standard operations notifications. We set the goal to improve our
notification and debugging capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With fresh provisioning, we now also have a programmatic approach towards
setting up system checks and notifications, and have expanded our reporting
a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;update-details&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ops&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Fresh web servers&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Last month, we rolled out fresh build servers, strictly using configuration
management to provision servers. This month, we continued by moving web
server provision to our configuration management and re-rolling all of our
web servers.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Fresh database servers and migration&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also rolled new database servers, and took the opportunity to upgrade our
database’s PostgreSQL instance and perform some needed schema changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to perform the migration late one evening, when our then primary
database server was included in an outage of some Rackspace infrastructure.
The outage resulted in some extended downtime, and we were not immediately
able to migrate data from the database server to the fresh instance. The
outage resolved early in the morning and migration wrapped shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new instance performed better than expected, once we made it live.  The
fresh instance had more memory and increased bandwidth for disk operations.
Along with a reindex of a table with slow queries, we noticed significant
reduction in query times and a great improvement of stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Improved monitoring&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We started to catch some edge cases that were not previously monitored and
improved greatly on our monitoring and graphing.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;dev&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dev&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Django 1.8 upgrade&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Our previous version of Django was on the now unsupported 1.6 branch. With
1.8 released, we felt it was a great chance to finally upgrade our
dependencies.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Triage process&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We have formalized our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contribute.html#triaging-tickets&quot;&gt;triage process&lt;/a&gt; for development. This will guide
how we make decisions on our issue tracker.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Linting&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Linting has not been performed on the codebase for a long while. We felt
this was important to get back to in order to ensure code quality.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Stable version improvements&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;There has been some buggy behavior behind the stable version detection. We
worked here to clean up some of the broken behavior.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Fix slugging on versions&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;There have been a number of error cases that have surfaced around version
slugging recently. This works to fix some logic errors on edge cases.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;issues&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the month of July:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Docs saw &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=created%3A2015-07-01..2015-07-31+type%3Aissue&quot;&gt;80 new issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50 of those issues &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=created%3A2015-07-01..2015-07-31+type%3Aissue+state%3Aclosed&quot;&gt;have been closed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=created%3A%3C2015-07-01+type%3Aissue+state%3Aclosed+closed%3A2015-07-01..2015-07-31&quot;&gt;35 outstanding issues&lt;/a&gt; were closed out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to raise any questions you have about any of these changes on our
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues&quot;&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;, or on our Freenode IRC channel, #readthedocs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;goals-for-next-month&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals for Next Month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Improve Github/Bitbucket integration&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We have pushed this up to next month, we still need to address some failures
as part of Github/Bitbucket integration.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Better Sphinx experience for authoring&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We can streamline a lot of the experience around using Sphinx, and at the
same time, make more reproduceable builds, locally, for authors. This would
involve mimicking more of what we preform in our build backend for local
authoring.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;More code cleanup&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We started some linting efforts to bring code quality up, we will continue
deeper and more thorough linting efforts.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;More features to user gold subscription&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We would like to have more users on a recurring subscription, which is a
great step towards sustainability. We should be surfacing features and
reminding users to donate if they are using some of those features.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;report-august-2015&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August was a busy month for us. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/&quot;&gt;Write the Docs Europe&lt;/a&gt; was at the end of the
month, and our focus has been on getting &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://readthedocs.com&quot;&gt;readthedocs.com&lt;/a&gt; into a
public beta state. We’re nearing the end of the 3 month period that we budgeted
for as part of our fundraiser and have a few more tasks to push out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, an update of the goals we set for this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Improve Github/Bitbucket integration&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We fixed a very common bug caused by the way implemented syncing to the
Github API. There are still some user experience issues we would like to
address.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Better Sphinx experience for authoring&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We started to refactor parts of our build backend and discussed what the
optimal tool for authors would be. We don’t have a clear sense of where to
split up our build backend code and what is extraneous to authors yet,
however.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;More code cleanup&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Linting cleanup progressed, and we are on to discussing stricter linting
efforts.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;More features to user gold subscription&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We have added the ability to “bless” projects with a gold subscription, but
are still working on the user experience behind reminding users to donate
via gold subscriptions, nor are we explaining gold to users yet.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;update-details&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Build backend refactor&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;The builder backend code was refactored and now all build commands executed
are tracked and associated with builds. This surfaced a number of hidden
commands and a few failure conditions that were being disregarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also removes the confusing magic PDF build that gets triggered from a
normal build object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Build output page&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;With the build refactor tracking all commands separately, we can now show
output of all the commands executed. Before this output was split into
output and error output streams, and it wasn’t always easy to distinguish
failures. The build output page will now also live update through the API as
changes become available.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Improved Github Syncing&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Our initial attempt at Github integration updated from the Github API
in-process, which could result in a timeout when the API didn’t return quick
enough. Syncing against the API was moved to our task queue, with an API to
monitor changes to the task.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Started work on more automated build toolchain&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;We have plans to make the process for building Sphinx documentation more
automated for authors. We started laying out plans for what that tool would
look like and how it would function.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;issues&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the month of August:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Docs saw &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=created%3A2015-08-01..2015-08-31+type%3Aissue&quot;&gt;55 new issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;36 of those issues &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=created%3A2015-08-01..2015-08-31+type%3Aissue+state%3Aclosed&quot;&gt;have been closed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=created%3A%3C2015-08-01+type%3Aissue+state%3Aclosed+closed%3A2015-08-01..2015-08-31&quot;&gt;59 outstanding issues&lt;/a&gt; were closed out&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;goals-for-next-month&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals for Next Month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Improve gold subscriptions more&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;With the fundraiser funds nearly allocated, we need to begin budgeting for
the next few months, and will need to start bringing in income. We want to
improve the user experience around donating, as well as present more
reminders to donate to active users.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Increase income for the community site&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;With better user experience around donating, we hope to launch another
effort to get more users and companies to donate.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Improve import user experience&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;There are still some gritty parts to the import process that should be
streamlined. Some of the major Github bugs have been squashed, but a larger
UX improvement is still required.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;report-june-2015&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://writethedocs.org&quot;&gt;Write the Docs&lt;/a&gt; conference wrapped up in May, we shifted our focus
back to Read the Docs for the remainder of May and June. Following our post
&lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../read-the-docs-is-hiring/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;on contract positions available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with Read the
Docs, we hired two contractors to work with us and focus on support and
stability for readthedocs.org. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/gregmuellegger&quot;&gt;Gregor Müllegger&lt;/a&gt; will be working on support
and development, and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/onewheelskyward&quot;&gt;Andrew Kreps&lt;/a&gt; has helped us on building and improving our
operations infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;updates&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs had the following major updates in June:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ops&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elastic Search support was upgraded and our search cluster is now hosted on
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://found.no&quot;&gt;Found&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We greatly improved the Read the Docs infrastructure, including monitoring and alerting, as well as server
environment consistency. Using Nagios and Graphite, as well as Salt, for this task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static assets were migrated to use a CDN, provided by &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://maxcdn.com&quot;&gt;MaxCDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We did a fresh provision of our build cluster using Salt. Previously, there were slight
disparities between the servers, which surfaced some issues during builds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed Python 3 build environments with new virtualenv and pip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed our queueing strategy to not be tied to a single specific build machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;dev&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dev&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output formats such as PDF and ePub are now configurable, but continue to default
to on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the ability to wipe the Build environment to the Versions page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started to address issues with stable version detection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed issues related to version name slugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to move away from third party analytics, we have spun up an instance
of Piwik. We plan on testing this with our production traffic in the coming months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed “Edit on GitHub” links for stable versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General refactoring and cleanup of the codebase, and added test coverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;issues&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have started to formalize on a ticket triage process and have more focus on
performing project management in the open. This is a very welcome change to our
existing workflow and hope to continue improving on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the month of June:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Docs saw &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=created%3A2015-06-01..2015-06-30+type%3Aissue&quot;&gt;50 new issues&lt;/a&gt; in the month of June&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;26 of those issues &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=created%3A2015-06-01..2015-06-30+type%3Aissue+state%3Aclosed&quot;&gt;have been closed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=created%3A2015-06-01..2015-06-30+type%3Aissue+state%3Aopen&quot;&gt;The remaining 24&lt;/a&gt; have been triaged but remain unresolved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=created%3A%3C2015-06-01+type%3Aissue+state%3Aclosed+closed%3A2015-06-01..2015-06-30&quot;&gt;19 outstanding issues&lt;/a&gt; were closed out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;next-month&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once work is wrapped up on version detection cleanup, we hope to start
improving our Github/Bitbucket integration and user experience
issues around deleting old projects and versions from Read the Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also be testing internal analytics in the coming months. Our stance is
that user data, for both our users and for readers of hosted documentation,
should not be handed over to third party services like Google Analytics. We hope
to replace external analytics with an internally hosted service, so that your
data remains with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to raise any questions you have about any of these changes on our
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues&quot;&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;, or on our Freenode IRC channel, #readthedocs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our successful &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.readthedocs.com/fundraising-wrapup/&quot;&gt;fundraiser&lt;/a&gt;,
we have the ability to pay people to work on Read the Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two positions that we are looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community Developer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operations Developer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will be part-time remote contract positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our budget is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40 total hours each week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paid at $50/hr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These hours will be split between the two roles,
and our time managing and doing administrative tasks.
We expect each person to work around 15-20 hours each week.
It will initially be for a 3-month period,
after which we will evaluate the program,
and continue it with renewed funding if it is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand that money and time can be an obstacle to working on OSS,
so let this be your opportunity to join us!
We are hoping to build a team that is diverse in view points and location,
and that definitely includes folks like you.
Historically under-represented folks in the open source world will be given preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;community-developer&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community Developer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will help us build community and give our users a better experience.
Help us make the code base better,
and build a thriving open source project along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your jobs will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triage and fix bugs as they come in via GitHub, IRC, and the Mailing List&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work through the back log of GitHub Issues, fixing and closing them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing ongoing maintenance of the code base, including upgrading Django versions, refactoring, and other technical debt clean up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work onboarding developers into the code base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech Used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux (Ubuntu)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nginx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Django&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sphinx &amp;amp; Docutils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s fine if you aren’t familiar with all of these things, but are willing to learn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;operations-developer&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Operations Developer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will help us operate the largest open source documentation website in the world.
We currently get over 15,000,000 pageviews a month,
and we hope to maintain a reliable and stable hosting platform for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your responsibilities will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage backups of our databases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage usage of our web and build machines, keeping them up to date and within capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build new infrastructure and help us scale the existing machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write code to make Read the Docs easier to scale and sustain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be included in an On Call rotation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech Used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postgres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nagios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nginx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elastic Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Django&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s fine if you aren’t familiar with all of these things, but are willing to learn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will prefer candidates in non-US based time zones to simplify our on call rotation.&lt;/strong&gt;
Nobody should have to wake up at night to fix issues!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;how-to-apply&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Apply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for everyone who has applied. We are in the process of choosing a candidate, and applications are now closed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="text">Fundraising Wrapup</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;fundraising-wrapup&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, a big ol’ thank you is in order for everyone that helped support us.
You all helped us hit our funding goal, and with time to spare.  We’re humbled
to have such an abundance of support, and to know so many people share our
vision for great documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, thank you all. ❤&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started the fund raise drive at the beginning of PyCon, and in a little under
3 weeks you were able to bring us up to our funding goal of $24,000. With the
end of April, we’ve wrapped up fundraising for now. You can &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://readthedocs.org/sustainability/&quot;&gt;still contribute&lt;/a&gt;
however, and give us a head start on our next fund raising goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set our goal to cover support costs for the next 3 months, and to set Read
the Docs on a path to becoming self-sustaining. It will allow us to dedicate
time to supporting and maintaining the service as it continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve had &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://readthedocs.org/sustainability/#supporters&quot;&gt;157 contributions&lt;/a&gt;, and we couldn’t have hit our goal
without the help of everyone. The Python Software Foundation graciously provided
us with a grant for $8,000 to go towards the continued support efforts.  Our
largest corporate sponsors include &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://twilio.com&quot;&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://getsentry.com&quot;&gt;Sentry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://dreamhost.com&quot;&gt;DreamHost&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://lincolnloop.com&quot;&gt;Lincoln Loop&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, we have received generous service sponsorships
from &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://elastic.co&quot;&gt;Elastic Search&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://maxcdn.com&quot;&gt;MaxCDN&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://gandi.net&quot;&gt;Gandi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, a huge thank you to everyone that made this happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-to-expect&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to Expect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are building a company around an open source service, and we strive to remain
open about what we’re doing. As a first step, we will be documenting how our
time is used up and how we are allocating funds for the costs. We will be
providing updates on our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/tF04aNrT/read-the-docs-public&quot;&gt;public Trello board&lt;/a&gt;, we welcome you to
subscribe for updates and to provide us with feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds will go towards covering the support and maintenance costs of Read the
Docs each week. We want to increase our capacity to handle support requests by
working with someone on a part-time contract basis, working solely on managing
this support burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each week, the funds will pay for up to 40 hours of time spent supporting the
service.  We look to cover triaging support requests and operations maintenance
and emergency support with this time. Time will be split up between several
engineers, we hope to cover part of the week with our time and the majority of
the time each week with a third set of hands. Development will continue as a
community supported mechanism, with the time of the core team donated to the
project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
